          The first Tesla product, the Roadster sports car, debuted in 2008,
          followed by the Model S sedan, which was introduced in 2012, and the
          Model X SUV, which launched in 2015. Model S received Consumer
          Reports’ Best Overall Car and has been named the Ultimate Car of the
          Year by Motor Trend, while Model X was the first SUV ever to earn
          5-star safety ratings in every category and sub-category in the
          National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s tests. In 2017, Tesla
          began deliveries of Model 3, a mass-market electric vehicle with more
          than 320 miles of range, and unveiled Tesla Semi, which is designed to
          save owners at least $200,000 over a million miles based on fuel costs
          alone. In 2019, Tesla unveiled Cybertruck, which will have better
          utility than a traditional truck and more performance than a sports
          car, as well as the Model Y compact SUV, which began customer
          deliveries in early 2020.
